Command Line Parser Generator [1]
=================================

A tool for generating a driver intended to call one of the procedures declared
in a package specification, depending on the parameters passed to the driver.

The accepted command line arguments are derived from the formal parameters of
the available procedures.


Build and test
--------------

    make build

    make test


Examples
--------

The project comes with some examples (located in the `examples/` directory).
The program `command_line_parser_generator-run` can be used to analyse them:

    ./bin/command_line_parser_generator-run bad_declares_function

Notice that `command_line_parser_generator-run` contains hard-coded relative
paths, which means that it only looks for source files in `examples/` and
`src/`.
